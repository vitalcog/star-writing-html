          <p>Princess Star Butterfly is the main protagonist of Star vs. the Forces of Evil. She is a teenage princess of the kingdom of Mewni (located in another dimension) sent to Earth by her parents in order to learn how to use the royal magic wand.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Learning to control her wand</li>
            <li>Keeping the wand out of the wrong hands</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li> <h3>Marco Diaz</h3>
          <p>Marco is Star's best friend. He is kind, responsible, very organized, and supportive of others. He has a reputation at his school for being the "safe kid" due to avoiding danger and being cautious, though he insists that he is a "misunderstood bad boy".</p>
        </li>
        <li> <h3>Ludo</h3>
          <p>Ludo is a major antagonist of Star vs. the Forces of Evil. In season 1, he uses an army of monsters in order to steal Star's wand and take over the universe.
